Splice test tools
-----------------

A small collection of tools that I used during testing of splice. Some
of them might even be useful outside of that :-)

ktee:		Sort of like tee. It uses sys_tee to avoid moving the data to
		user space. ktee will sys_tee stdin to stdout, then consume
		stdin by splicing it to the given file.

ktee-net:	Like ktee, except it splices stdin to a network host.

splice-cp:	Splice input file to output file, basically copying the
		data. If the -m option is given, pages will be migrated
		instead of copied.

splice-in:	Splice given file to stdout.

splice-tonet:	Splice stdin network host.

splice-fromnet:	Splice from network stdout.

splice-out:	Splice stdin to given file.

splice-test4c:	Splice/sendfile test client. Use with splice-test4s. There
		must be a file of at least 128MiB called 'largefile' in the
		current directory, splice-test4c uses that as input data.

splice-test4s:	Dummy server for splice-test4c.

splice-bench:	Test various sides of splice performance.

vmsplice:
vmsplice2:	Splice user memory to a pipe.

All tools written by me, except splice-test4c/s which are from Ingo Molnar.
